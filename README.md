# ClusterDuck APP

The ClusterDuck App is an open-source tool built by the ClusterDuck Protocol community, an open-source effort released in partnership with the Linux Foundation in March 2020.  This tool allows you to connect to DuckLink devices over Bluetooth and share data.

DuckLinks, or Ducks, are simple Internet-of-Things devices built on a variety of cheap electronics you can acquire from AliExpress or Amazon.  Once the ClusterDuck Protocol firmware is uploaded, these devices can sync with others nearby to cover large areas as a mesh-network. 

This is a BETA version and development is ongoing.  There most certainly will be bugs.  Want to build with us?  Join our Slack channel and jump into to daily development conversation:  http://clusterduckprotocol.org/slack

### Use the app

#### 1. Build a ClusterDuck Network
You will need to setup a simple ClusterDuck Network to use the app to interface with your Ducks. You will need a special BLE-Duck that you can find [here](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/ClusterDuck-Protocol/blob/master/examples/4.Ble-Duck-App/Ble-Duck-App/Ble-Duck-App.ino)  and a PapaDuck whoch is explained in the getting started[here](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/ClusterDuck-Protocol/wiki/getting-started)

#### 2. Install the App from the play store or From Android Studio

#### 3. Connect the App to your BLE Duck
